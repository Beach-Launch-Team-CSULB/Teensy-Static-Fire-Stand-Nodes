Notes on separating this class into two classes. Ideally there would be a BitBuffer class,
and an AbstractCanPacket class. 

BitBuffer: Would handle all low level reads and writes to the CAN packet. Ideally, 
this would only look at a CAN frame as a continuous buffer to be read from or written to.

AbstractCanPacket: Would contain the arrays of MiniPackets as well as Priority and nodeID.
You can set the priority and nodeID, add MiniPackets, and sendCanMessage while writing,
and while reading from CAN frame, can construct from CAN, get the priority and nodeID,
and get the MiniPacket. 

Setting and getting the extendedID shouldn't even be a thing, it should just figure that out
before sending the CAN frame.
